				Problem
			</h1>
			<p>
				Current school discipline systems lack empathy and often leave students feeling confused and neglected, inevitably causing a cycle of negative behavior.  
			</p>
			<h1>
				Solution
			</h1>
			<p>
				Token is a tactile toolkit that facilitates a mutual
				understanding between authority figures and
				students during disciplinary conversations. Token
				fosters a change in studentsâ€™ behavior and
				implements empathy into the institutional discipline
				system.

			<h1>
				Problem
			</h1>
			<p>
				Memories have lost their significance and meaning because of instant documentation.  As people age, cognitive decline begins to cloud their memories and the need to reminisce, relive, and share their memories with friends and family increase. 
			</p>
			<h1>
				Solution
			</h1>
			<p>
				Memori is an immersive Virtual Reality platform that allows users to re-experience and share a memory.  Through a memory reconstruction process utilizing the power of storytelling, memories are recalled through conversation and sensory cues led by Flow, the systemâ€™s personalized voice assistant.

			<h1>Researcher, designer, and growing with experience.</h1>
			<p>Hello! Iâ€™m a researcher, designer, and professional cellist. I was raised in Fairbanks Alaska and Hinesville, Georgia and after graduating with a bachelorâ€™s in music performance in 2016, I embarked on my journey as a UX Researcher. Iâ€™m in my fnal year at SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design), obtaining a B.F.A. in User Experience Design. 

				Being half Korean, raised in a military family, and part of a lower-income community has shaped the way I view the world. Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve always observed, analyzed and empathized with peopleâ€™s emotions. And as a classical cellist, I have been given the gift to share human emotion through music. During my last year in music school, I realized I wanted to do more than share from the stage. As a researcher, my goal is to understand the needs of others to create solutions that improve human interaction. 

				Thank you for coming here and listening to my story!
